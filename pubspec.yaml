  A cross-platform distributed-computing framework for dart.

  Nodes in a distributed network may be browser or server based. True
  peer-to-peer communication is only supported between server --> browser or
  server --> server connections, but browser --> browser communication is
  possible by allowing a server-based node to act as a relay, forwarding
  messages between peers.
